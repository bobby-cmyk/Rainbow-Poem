"Ode to a Rainbow"

Oh, rainbow so bold, so bright, so tall,
Youâ€™re natureâ€™s Skittlesâ€”taste the rainbow, yâ€™all!
Red and orange, yellow and green,
Blue and indigoâ€”wait, whereâ€™s violet been?

You arch like a bridge for leprechaun feet,
Or a colorful frown when the rainâ€™s bittersweet.
But hereâ€™s the real tea, the scandal, the scoop:
Youâ€™re just sun playing tricksâ€”you prismatic goof!

So shine on, you show-off, you flashy delight,
Just promise youâ€™ll never wear neon at night! ðŸŒˆâœ¨

"Rainbow Radiance"

Red gets angry when Orange steals his lunch,
Yellow just laughs while Green turns with a munch.
Blue feels sad that no one called today,
While Indigo and Violet dance away.
Seven colors having quite the day,
A spectrum of drama on display!
When rain meets sun, they all appear,
A colorful committee hanging in the air.

Red is for rage when Wi-Fi goes down,
Orange for Cheetos that stain my new gown.
Yellowâ€™s my wallet (itâ€™s empty and sad),
Greenâ€™s for the veggies I pretend that I had.
Blue is my mood when thereâ€™s chores to be done,
Indigoâ€™s bedtime... at quarter past one.
Violetâ€™s me trying to jog â€” just... no.
Together we sparkle: a hot rainbow show! ðŸŒˆ
